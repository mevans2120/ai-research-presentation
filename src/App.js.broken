          content: "I've long been someone who tracks and adopts new technology as quickly as I can. And while I certainly got excited when ChatGPT launched. I started using itfor spelling / grammar checker, when I remembered, but I never got that deep…\n\nThat's because I spent the past 1.5 years doing joyful hard work for opening up Casa Bonita to the general public. And while Casa Bonita is a complicated beast… Cliff divers, thousands of covers,  Mexican food and all… Their digital products don't need AI. And, anybody who knows me, knows that I get single minded when presented with a set of challenging problems. AI would have to wait. Also, go to Casa Bonita, it's wonderful there. \n\nAfter Casa Bonita I transitioned the digital products to Casa Bonita, I got laid off by my agency. The one blessing was that I could catch up on AI. \n\nAs part of a mini-sabbatical, I wanted to answer a question: utilizing AI, could I design and develop and ship something useful all by myself? It didn't take me long to learn that the answer was: \n\n\"Yes. You can actually build something useful that would typically take days… in hours.\" \n\nHoly shit. In the next 5 years, will I be able to ask Claude to \"build me an airline website\" and have it get a majority of the work done? Will AI unlock massive amounts of new products that weren't feasible or cost effective? Or should I get out of the industry and try to open a yoga studio? I didn't have a good sense about what the answer would be. I was also thinking about my children, would their creativity and intellect be useful in the future. Deep breaths…\n\nWhile I'd been living under a rock, most of my colleagues and peers had not. How were they using AI? How were they working with it? Is it hard to build a custom agent (spoiler: it's not that hard)?\n\nSimilar to when I was going through a divorce, I decided to conduct some personal research with a set of smart colleagues and friends who I figure would have thought about this and have some expertise. The divorce research was incredibly useful. Hopefully this would be as well."

          type: "thought-experiment",
          title: "Chatphone Concept",
          content: `While talking with one of the participants, we got onto the topic of agentic chat becoming a contextual layer between the tools your phone provides and how you access and use those tools.

As someone who designed and built the Before Launcher, finding better ways to use our smartphones is a catnip-like obsession for me.

The participant and I, exchanging texts, landed on the idea of a conceptually aware phone—one whose interface changes based on your "mode." While not a new idea by any means, AI seems uniquely suited to help make this a reality.

Diagram 1, at the top of this page, illustrates how this might work. After the ChatPhone onboards onto your primary usage contexts (a fascinating and likely ongoing process in itself), the phone's homescreen would display:
<ul>
<li>The primary tools you're likely to use in that mode</li>
<li>A digest of potentially relevant messages</li>
<li>Quick access to agentic chat</li>
</ul>

This type of phone could offer several benefits:
<ul>
<li>Speed up how quickly you find things on your phone</li>
<li>Reduce the need for repetitive decision-making (e.g., which delivery app or pizza place to choose)</li>
<li>Minimize distractions from content or tools best reserved for other contexts</li>
</ul>

Of course, using an agent as an intermediary introduces the risk of it missing key or critical content. That's why this concept feels better suited for a time when AI has matured to the point of being more reliable than you are at completing certain tasks.

Also, I doubt toolmakers like DoorDash, Lyft, Google, Apple, and others would appreciate being further commoditized—since their apps would no longer be the primary way users access the services they offer.

Curious to hear what you think about the idea.`,

Her old existing website is at Karunagatton.com.  There should be a homepage, an offerings page, a get in touch page, a drum circle page and an about karuna page.

(e.g., \"Book a Session,\" \"Join the Circle,\" \"Learn More\")\n\n2. Offerings Page\nWhat types of offerings does Karuna provide? (e.g., one-on-one healing sessions, energy work, spiritual guidance, retreats?)\n\nFor each offering:\n\n   ○ What's it called?\n\n   ○ What does it involve?\n\n   ○ How long is a session?\n\n   ○ What's the price?\n\n   ○ Are sessions virtual, in-person, or both?\n\n   ○ Should people be able to book from this page?\n\n3. Drum Circle Page\nAre the drum circles recurring or one-off events?\n\nAre they open to the public or invite-only?\n\nWhat's the typical structure or vibe?\n\nShould there be a calendar or RSVP function?\n\nWould you want photos, recordings, or testimonials from past circles?\n\n4. Get in Touch Page\nWhat's the preferred method of contact? (Email, form, phone, social media?)\n\nShould it include a physical location (e.g., directions to the yurt)?\n\nDo you want to include a contact form with specific fields?\n\nIs there a newsletter or mailing list people can sign up for?\n\n5. About Karuna Page\nWhat should visitors know about her background, training, lineage, or philosophy?\n\nShould this be written in her voice (\"Hi, I'm Karuna…\") or in third person?\n\nDo you want to include personal photos or images from her work?\""
