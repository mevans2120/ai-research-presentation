const EVERYONE_ELSE_ABOUT_CONTENT = `Over the past couple months, I've taken time to dig deeply into AI-powered coding tools. I've dug into them as a user, and as a researcher trying to understand their utility and their trajectory. My goal wasn't just to build faster, but to assess whether these tools can meaningfully shift how digital products get designed and shipped‚Äîand what that might mean for teams like mine.

Until recently, I hadn't had time to explore AI development tools in depth. I'd been fully focused on launching complex digital systems for a high-profile hospitality experience. But after wrapping up that project, I had the space to experiment‚Ä¶

I started by testing whether a technical non-engineer type person (me) could use AI to go from concept to working product without development assistance. The results were eye-opening. Tools like Claude and Cursor are already capable of accelerating workflows that used to require full teams. It raised a series of deeper questions:

* What kinds of products are now possible that weren't viable before?

* How are my peers‚Äîdesigners, engineers, PMs‚Äîactually using these tools today?

* Where do they see the biggest potential? The biggest risks?

* Will these tools augment teams‚Ä¶ or replace some of them?

This exploration has turned into an ongoing research effort. Through interviews, prototyping, and tool audits, I'm mapping out not just what AI coding tools can do today, and where I think they are likely headed.`;

          content: `I've always been someone who tracks and adopts new technology as quickly as I can. I was certainly excited when ChatGPT launched. I used it here and there as a spelling and grammar checker‚Äîwhen I remembered‚Äîbut I never went that deep.\n\nThat's because I spent the past 1.5 years doing joyful, hard work helping open Casa Bonita to the general public. And while Casa Bonita is a complicated beast‚Äîcliff divers, thousands of covers, Mexican food and all‚Äîtheir digital products didn't need AI. Anyone who knows me knows I get single-minded when presented with a set of challenging problems. AI would have to wait. (Also, go to Casa Bonita. It's wonderful.)\n\nAfter successfully transitioning the digital products to Casa Bonita, I was laid off by my agency. The silver lining? I finally had time to catch up on AI.\n\nAs part of a mini-sabbatical, I set out to answer a question: using AI, could I design, develop, and ship something useful all by myself? It didn't take long to find the answer:\n\n**"Yes. You can actually build something useful that would typically take days‚Ä¶ in hours."**\n\nHoly shit. In the next five years, will I be able to ask Claude to "build me an airline website" and have it do most of the work? Will AI unlock a wave of new products that previously weren't feasible or cost-effective? Or should I leave the industry and open a yoga studio? I honestly didn't know. I was also thinking about my children‚Äîwould their creativity and intellect still be useful in the future? Deep breaths‚Ä¶\n\nWhile I'd been living under a rock, most of my colleagues hadn't. How were they using AI? How were they working with it? Is it hard to build a custom agent? (Spoiler: it's not that hard.)`

After the ChatPhone onboards onto your primary usage contexts (a fascinating and likely ongoing process in itself), the phone's homescreen would display:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The primary tools you're likely to use in that mode</li>\n<li>A digest of prioritized information and action based on your behavior and preferences.</li>\n<li>Quick access to agentic chat</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This type of phone could offer several benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Speed up how quickly you find things on your phone</li>\n<li>Reduce the need for repetitive decision-making (e.g., which delivery app or pizza place to choose)</li>\n<li>Minimize distractions from content or tools best reserved for other contexts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, using an agent as an intermediary introduces the risk of it missing key or critical content. That's why this concept feels better suited for a time when AI has matured to the point of being more reliable than you are at completing certain tasks.</p>\n\n<p>Also, while I doubt toolmakers like DoorDash, Lyft, Google, Apple, and others would appreciate being further commoditized‚Äîsince their apps would no longer be the primary way users access the services they offer, they may have less of a choice when they can't distinguish between an AI accessing their app versus a person. It will be interesting to see how this plays out.</p>\n\n<p>I've been using though experiments like this one to get excited about possible innovations in the future, validate how I think and feel about AI's current and future usage. If AI could execute something like the Chatphone Concept, while maintaining my privacy and agency, count me in as a user.</p>`,
